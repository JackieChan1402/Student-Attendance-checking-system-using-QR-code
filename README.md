# Student-Attendance-checking-system-using-QR-code

A university student attendance system project, including a central Web API, a desktop app for lecturers to manage and export attendance, and a mobile app for students to check in via QR code over local network. Supports offline attendance with automatic synchronization, aiming to streamline and digitize attendance tracking.

The system supports lecturers and students in the roll call process.

### Lecturers

* Use computer software on the Windows operating system.
* Connect to classroom WiFi to create a QR code containing class information.

### Students

* Use phones and connect to the same classroom WiFi network.
* Scan the QR code or access the link to roll call.

### Authentication Process

* The system verifies the physical MAC address of student devices to authenticate their presence in class.
* Students must register their device's MAC address with the system via an Android application before attending classes.

### Data Export

* After finishing the course, lecturers can export the roll call list as an Excel file.
* The exported file can be stored or imported into the school's management system.
